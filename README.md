# passwordgenerator

## Description

If you are like me, then you often times have time coming up with an effective and safe password. In this application, you will declare what kinds of characters you want your password to contain and how long it will be, then it will generate a randomized one for you. 

### Listed below is a brief explanation on how I achieved this: 

* I started with an HTML and CSS layout that is visually pleasing and then added logic to its elements:
    * I added functionality to the 'generate password' button with this code:
    * ![](assets/Capture2.png)

    
    

* I then added an event listener to watch for a click on the 'generate password' button.

* Finally, I added a function that would convert the character selections into an array that would choose at random with this:
    * ![](assets/Capture3.png)

## Usage

This application should be used when security from hackers is what you need. The more generic a password is, the easier it will be for someone to get into your information. It is a very easy app to use and will allow you to copy the generated password for easy copying.
